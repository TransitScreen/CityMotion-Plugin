# CityMotion Plugin Documentation and Code Examples

This documentation and code is intended to help partner mobile apps integrate CityMotion Plugin. 

An API key and partner agreement are required - please email sales@transitscreen.com.

Once you have those, **please [review this documentation](https://github.com/TransitScreen/CityMotion-Webview/blob/master/api-documentation/citymotion-web-api-documentation.md)** which will tell you what you need to know about the API and different endpoints you can use!

**Code samples** for iOS and Android are available if you clone this repository - [you can see a summary here](https://github.com/TransitScreen/CityMotion-Plugin/blob/master/api-documentation/code-samples.md).
